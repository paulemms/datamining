title: "The R datamining package"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is a packaged collection of R functions for data mining originally developed by Thomas Minka for [teaching at CMU](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~tpminka/courses/36-350/). 

There are many other packages on CRAN that can replicate this functionality. However, the idea of using visualisation to build regression models is attractive, and the package only depends on base R.

## Examples

You can load the package in RStudio using the `devtools` package:

```{r load, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
devtools::load_all(".")
```

The package contains a number of example data sets. The data below is 
a modified version of the `Boston` data set in the `MASS` package.

```{r housing}
data(Housing)
head(Housing)
```

An example plot is shown below.

```{r color_plot}
color.plot(Price ~ Rooms + Low.Status, Housing, color.palette=YlGnBu.colors)
```
